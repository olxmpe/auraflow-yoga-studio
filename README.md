# AuraFlow Yoga Studio

AuraFlow is a fictional yoga studio. The aim of this project is to learn the basics of CSS animation, while creating a strong visual identity and animations that I'd like to see when I'm out and about on the web. It may evolve and grow as I learn new things.

## What would the studio be like if it really existed?

At AuraFlow, we believe in the power of mindful movement and the art of relaxation. Our studio is a sanctuary where every detail is curated to elevate your experience—from the moment you step through our doors to the final savasana.
Whether you're a seasoned yogi or new to the mat, our classes are designed to help you connect with your inner calm. Our experienced instructors guide you through each pose with care, ensuring you find your flow and leave feeling revitalized.
In our tranquil, light-filled space, you'll find a blend of traditional yoga practices and modern wellness techniques. Each class is a journey toward balance, strength, and peace.

At AuraFlow, we embrace the idea that wellness is not just a destination but a continuous journey. Through yoga, meditation, and mindful living, we offer you the tools to live a more centered and fulfilling life.
